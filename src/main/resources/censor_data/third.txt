“People,"  turned his head, "like to invent monsters and monstrosities.
Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal,
beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe
or riddle the  existing unicorn with arrows,
they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are.

They feel better then. They find it easier to live.”

― Andrzej Sapkowski, The  Wish
