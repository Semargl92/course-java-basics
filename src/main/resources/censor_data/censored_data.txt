“People,"  turned his head, "like to invent monsters and monstrosities.
Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal,
beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe
or riddle the  existing unicorn with arrows,
they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are.

They feel better then. They find it easier to live.”

― Andrzej Sapkowski, The  Wish
 is no emotion,  is peace.
 is no ignorance,  is knowledge.
 is no passion,  is serenity.
 is no chaos,  is harmony.
 is no death,  is the .
Peace is a lie.  is only Passion.
Through Passion I gain Strength.
Through Strength I gain Power.
Through Power I gain Victory.
Through Victory my chains are Broken.
The  shall free me.
