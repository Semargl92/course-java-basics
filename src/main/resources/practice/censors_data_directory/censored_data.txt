  no emotion,   peace.
  no ignorance,   knowledge.
  no passion,   serenity.
  no chaos,   harmony.
  no death,   the Force.

Peace  a lie.   only Passion.
Through Passion I gain Strength.
Through Strength I gain Power.
Through Power I gain Victory.
Through Victory my chains are Broken.
The Force shall free me.
